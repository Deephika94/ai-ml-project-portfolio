# AI-ML Project Portfolio

This repository is a 60-week structured roadmap for mastering machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI.  
Each week includes hands-on projects, covering topics like:

- Core ML algorithms (Supervised and Unsupervised)
- Deep Neural Networks (ANN, CNN, RNN)
- NLP with Transformers and BERT
- LLM-powered applications (RAG, LangChain, Hugging Face)
- MLOps and deployment
